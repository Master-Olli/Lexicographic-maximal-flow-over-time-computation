This repository contains only one file, a Python-code for the computation of a lexicographic-maximal-flow-over-time. The implementation is based on the algorithm by Hoppe and Tardos. You need to install two additional packages in order to execute the code. I recommend to use a virtual environment.
The first package NetworkX is one of the most common used packages for graphs in Python and neccessary for the functions.
The second package osmnx is used to load real-world data from OpenStreetMap and load it as a networkx graph, so this one is nice for instances for the code.
